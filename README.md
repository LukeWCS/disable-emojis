## Disable Emojis
Extension for phpBB - Only serves as a temporary solution until phpBB itself offers the appropriate settings: This will disable the S9E TextFormatter Emoji plugin for new or modified posts. In addition, the display of Emojis in existing posts is suppressed. This also applies to PMs.
